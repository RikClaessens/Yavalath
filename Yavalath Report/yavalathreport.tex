\begin{abstract}
Yavalath is a board game created by a computer program called Ludi. This paper describes a Alpha-Beta implementation for the game of Yavalath. A number of enhancements over the vanilla $\alpha \beta$-framework and their impact on game playing performance is evaluated.

\section{The Game of Yavalath}
\label{-sec:thegameofyavalath}
Yavalath is played on board made up of a hexagonal grid of 61 cells. It is the first commercial board game that was generated by a computer program. This general game system is called Ludi and was created by Cameron Browne. The rules of Yavalath are defined in the \ac{GDL} as presented in Listing \ref{lst:yavalathgdl}.

As the game is defined in just these few lines, the rules are very straightforward. The game is played with 2 player, White and Black and is played on a hexagonal shaped board of size 5 (Figure \ref{fig:emptyboard}). Allowed moves consist of placing a stone on one of the free cells remaining on the board. A player wins if he completes a line of four but loses if he completes a line of three before. The commonly used swap rule is also used in Yavalath in order to avoid a too strong opening move option for White. 

\input{figures/emptyboard.tex}

One of the key aspects of Yavalath is the forcing move. When a player has - in any direction - a line consisting of one stone of his color, one free cell and then another two stone of his color, he forces his opponent to play a forced move. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forcedmoves}. By playing the move marked 1, White forces Black to play move 2 (forced moves are labeled in red), thereby forcing Black to create a line of three, which means that Black will lose. This mechanic will prove essential for the developed agent as by using forced moves it is possible to limit your opponents options and in a way controlling where he is able to make his next move.

\input{figures/forcedmoves.tex}

Its simple set of rules and the unique winning condition is what Yavalath is most famous for and what made it one of the most popular board games on the website \url{www.boardgamegeek.com}. The game could also be played with three players where the only difference is that a player that makes a line of three leaves the game, after which the game is continued until a player wins by creating a line of four or by being the only remaining in the game. Furthermore, the active player is required to play any moves that would be part of a line of four if the part of a line of four during a subsequent move of the player that has this position.

\section{Evaluation Function}
\label{-sec:evaluationfunction}

Crucial for any AI player is a well-performing evaluation function. We discuss the Yavalath evaluation function according to seven principles as presented in \cite{Winands2004}. These seven principles include: \begin{enumerate*}\item threats, \item solid formations, \item mobility, \item blocking, \item centralisation, \item material advantage and \item initiative\end{enumerate*}.

\subsection{Inapplicable evaluation function features}
\label{-subsec:inapplicableevaluationfunctionfeatures}
First we describe the features that are inapplicable for Yavalath and why that is the case.

\subsubsection{Mobility}
\label{-subsubsec:mobility}
As there are no restrictions where a player is able to move and pieces are not moved across the board, but instead placed at empty squares, mobility does not play a role in Yavalath.

\subsubsection{Material Advantage}
\label{-subsubsec:materialadvantage}
Another feature that is in inapplicable for Yavalath is material advantage. This is the case because pieces cannot be captured by other players. Therefore, the number of pieces on the board is equal to the number of moves made thus far and all players will have the same number of pieces on the board after a complete game round.

\subsection{Threats}
\label{-subsec:threats}
A returning aspect of Yavalath is forcing your opponent to make certain moves. In this way one is able to limit his opponents options. A formation that could lead to a forced move for the player can therefore be seen as a threat. This is the case when in any straight line of four fields, there are three pieces of the opponent's color and one free field in between (Figure \ref{fig:threat}).

\input{figures/threat.tex}

\subsection{Solid Formations}
\label{-subsec:solidformations}
There are a number of solid formations in the game of Yavalath. Forcing the opponent to make certain moves is a crucial aspect of Yavalath and it also place a strong role in determining strong formations. A number of these formations are described in \cite{browne2011evolutionary} and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:solidformations}. These triangles each form a basis on which White can force Black to play certain moves and, if Black fails to block the position in a proper way, will lead to a win for White.

\input{figures/solidformations.tex}

The strength of these triangle formation lies in the fact that they can be applied in three \emph{directions of play} and two \emph{rotations of play}. What we mean with this is that the first move can be played along one of three sides of the triangle as well as 2 rotations of the triangle.

In addition to the formations presented in \cite{browne2011evolutionary} (Figure \ref{fig:solidformations}), we would like to add several combinations of these triangles of size 2, 3 and 4. These formations, along with the winning move sequence are presented in Figure \ref{fig:additionalsolidformations}.

\input{figures/additionalsolidformations.tex}

These additional formations do not have the advantage that they can be played in any direction like the formations in Figure \ref{fig:solidformations}. However, it is clear that formations that can be used to force the opponent to move are crucial in Yavalath.

\subsection{Centralisation}
\label{-subsec:centralisation}
Another part of the evaluation function for the game of Yavalath is centralisation. The intuition behind this feature is that playing near the center of the board gives the player more options to choose from, \ie more directions to play in. Therefore we give all fields a score, based on the distance to the center. These scores are shown in Figure \ref{fig:scores}.

\input{figures/scores.tex}

However, because of the swap rulex, we remove the bonus for the central two hexagonal circles (all fields with scores of $40$ or $50$) for the first move if the AI player is White. This is to prevent the player from playing a move that will very likely be swapped during Black's first move anyway, thereby losing his first move advantage.

\subsection{Initiative}
\label{-subsec:initiative}
The last evaluation function principle proposed by \cite{Winands2004} is initiative. Obtaining the initiative in the game of Yavalath is useful for forcing moves by the opponent, thereby limiting his options and with that his ability to force moves for the AI player. Because of this the sooner, a move can be forced by the AI player, the better.
