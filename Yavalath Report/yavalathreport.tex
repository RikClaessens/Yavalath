\begin{abstract}
Yavalath is a board game created by a computer program called Ludi. This paper describes a Alpha-Beta implementation for the game of Yavalath. A number of enhancements over the vanilla $\alpha \beta$-framework and their impact on game playing performance is evaluated.

\section{The Game of Yavalath}
\label{-sec:thegameofyavalath}
Yavalath is played on board made up of a hexagonal grid of 61 cells. It is the first commercial board game that was generated by a computer program. This general game system is called Ludi and was created by Cameron Browne. The rules of Yavalath are defined in the \ac{GDL} as presented in Listing \ref{lst:yavalathgdl}.

As the game is defined in just these few lines, the rules are very straightforward. The game is played with 2 player, White and Black and is played on a hexagonal shaped board of size 5 (Figure \ref{fig:emptyboard}). Allowed moves consist of placing a stone on one of the free cells remaining on the board. A player wins if he completes a line of four but loses if he completes a line of three before. The commonly used swap rule is also used in Yavalath in order to avoid a too strong opening move option for White.

One of the key aspects of Yavalath is the forcing move. When a player has - in any direction - a line consisting of one stone of his color, one free cell and then another two stone of his color, he forces his opponent to play a forced move. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forcedmoves}. By playing the move marked 1, White forces Black to play move 2, thereby forcing Black to create a line of three, which means that Black will lose. This tactic will prove essential for the developed agent as by using forced moves it is possible to limit your opponents options and in a way controlling where he is able to make his next move.

Its simple set of rules and the unique winning condition is what Yavalath is most famous for and what made it one of the most popular board games on the website \url{www.boardgamegeek.com}.
